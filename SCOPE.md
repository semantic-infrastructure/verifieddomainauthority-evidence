## Scope statement

Verified Domain Authority documents **domain-level proof of authority**.
The scope is limited to how a domain demonstrates legitimate control over
publication, modification, and revocation of statements or artifacts.

The scope concerns **verifiable signals**, not inferred reputation or popularity.

---

## Included

- **Domain ownership indicators**  
  Evidence that a domain is legitimately registered and controlled.

- **Editorial control signals**  
  Documentation of who is authorized to publish, modify, or retract content under a domain.

- **Publication integrity**  
  Mechanisms ensuring content has not been altered without record, including timestamps and signatures.

- **Change accountability**  
  Documented procedures for updates, corrections, and revocations.

- **Attribution boundaries**  
  Clear separation between domain authority and individual authorship.

---

## Excluded

- **Trust or reputation scoring**  
  No numerical or heuristic authority metrics are defined.

- **Search, ranking, or visibility signals**  
  Traffic, backlinks, and engagement are out of scope.

- **Certification or compliance assertions**  
  No formal certification, audit approval, or legal judgement is provided.

- **Content truthfulness or quality assessment**  
  Authority to publish is distinct from correctness of content.

---

## Boundary clarifications

- **Authority** refers to *legitimate control*, not influence or expertise.  
- **Verification** refers to *inspectability of evidence*, not approval.  
- **Domain-based** means authority is anchored at the domain level, not per author or account.

---

## Terminology baseline

Terminology aligns with established practices for domain control,
publication integrity, and verifiable artifacts.
Primary anchors are documented in `SOURCES.md`.

## Change control

Any modification to this scope requires:
