## Purpose

This repository provides the evidence layer for **Verified Domain Authority**, an independent reference documenting how domains can present **verifiable proof of authority** for published statements and artifacts.

The focus is on **inspectable legitimacy**, not on popularity, ranking, or reputation.

---

## What this repository is

- A **reference framework** for domain-based proof of authority
- A **definitions and boundaries repository**, not an implementation
- A **versioned artifact** suitable for audit, review, and machine consumption
- A **source-led model** for publication control and accountability

---

## What this repository is not

- Not a trust or reputation scoring system  
- Not a certification or endorsement service  
- Not a product or software implementation  
- Not an SEO or visibility optimization framework  

---

Covered areas include:

- Domain ownership and control indicators  
- Editorial responsibility and publication accountability  
- Integrity of published artifacts (timestamps, signatures, logs)  
- Correction, revocation, and change discipline  

Explicit exclusions are documented in `SCOPE.md`.
